- "Round off each ball of dough again, and line them up on a baking sheet. Leave to rise again until they are 1.5 to 2 times their original size. For me it took 30 minutes at 40°C."
- "Dust the surface with bread flour using a tea strainer. Slash the tops if you would like."
- "Bake in a preheated 210°C oven for 15 to 17 minutes. These rolls are chewier if you let them rest a bit before eating them."
- "From the next day on, the rolls will become nice and soft if you heat them up in the microwave. You can eat them as-is too of course."
