This is going to make some people deeply upset, I understand. They may say mean things about me. All you need is a good steak, a cast iron skillet, a gas grill with side burner (or stovetop and oven), butter and a high-smoke-point oil (like avocado oil), salt and pepper, and a pair of long-handled tongs. For optimal tenderness, they should be at near room temperature prior to searing.

All you need is a good steak, a cast iron skillet, a gas grill with side burner (or stovetop and oven), butter and a high-smoke-point oil (like avocado oil), salt and pepper, and a pair of long-handled tongs. For optimal tenderness, they should be at near room temperature prior to searing. Warm the oil until the surface just begins to shimmer (that&#39;s how we know it&#39;s hot enough to sear). Cooking steak in a cast-iron pan is ideal because cast-iron heats very evenly and retains heat extremely well. A pre-heated cast-iron skillet provides the intense heat needed to sear the exterior of a steak to a crispy, flavorful golden-brown, while also cooking the interior to perfection.
