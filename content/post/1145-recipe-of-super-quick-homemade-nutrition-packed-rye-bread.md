Hey everyone, it is Brad, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, nutrition-packed rye bread. It is one of my favorites. This time, I'm gonna make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Great recipe for Nutrition-Packed Rye Bread. I wanted to come up with a rye bread that&#39;s fluffy, since rye doesn&#39;t rise very well. Sticky dough is characteristic of rye flour. Pound down on the dough firmly when kneading.

Nutrition-Packed Rye Bread is one of the most favored of recent trending foods in the world. It is simple, it's fast, it tastes yummy. It's appreciated by millions every day. They are fine and they look fantastic. Nutrition-Packed Rye Bread is something that I have loved my entire life.


To get started with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can have nutrition-packed rye bread using 7 ingredients and 19 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Nutrition-Packed Rye Bread:

1. Get 200 grams Bread (strong) flour
1. Prepare 50 grams Rye flour (finely ground)
1. Prepare 1 and 1/2 tablespoon Sugar
1. Make ready 1/2 tsp Salt
1. Take 1 and 2/3 teaspoon Dry yeast
1. Take 170 ml Water

Rye bread is made from a mix of rye and wheat flour. Rye bread contains only small amounts of dough strengthening proteins. Rye flour has more amylase enzyme which breaks down starch into sugars. Rye doughs have less water than dough from ordinary flour to remain stiff and keep their shape.

Rye flour has more amylase enzyme which breaks down starch into sugars. Rye doughs have less water than dough from ordinary flour to remain stiff and keep their shape. From our Vietnamese Baguette, Dan&#39;s Como Bread, No Knead Rosemary Garlic Bread, No Knead NY Deli Rye, and the latest, Whole Wheat Honey Oat Bread, suffice to say we love homemade bread in this house. But we also want to ensure that we&#39;re still getting all the same nutrition that I was obsessed with while preggo with both the girls. This soup is particularly nice served with crusty rye bread and a leafy green salad with vinaigrette.
