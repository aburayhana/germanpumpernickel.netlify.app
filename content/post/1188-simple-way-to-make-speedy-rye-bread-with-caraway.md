##### The ingredients needed to make Rye Bread with Caraway:

1. Prepare 150 grams rye flour
1. Get 150 grams white bread flour
1. Make ready 1 tsp active dry yeast
1. Take 1 tsp sugar
1. Make ready 1 tsp salt
1. Get 1 cup warm water
1. Take 1 or 2 tsp caraway seeds


Stir yeast mixture into flour mixture until well mixed and caraway seeds are evenly distributed. In a large bowl, mix together the white flour, rye flour, active dry yeast, salt, sugar, fennel seeds and caraway seeds In a separate bowl, stir together the warm water and olive oil Make a well in the centre of the flour mixture and pour the water mixture into it The reason caraway seeds matter in this bread is that rye bread actually has a fairly mild flavor on its own. So kneading seeds like caraway, fennel, or anise into the dough or sprinkling seed mixes like Trader Joe&#39;s Everything Bagel Topping on top will give distinctive taste to a loaf of rye bread. Gradually add both flours, one cup at a time, mixing until dough comes away from sides of bowl and forms a ragged, slightly sticky ball.
