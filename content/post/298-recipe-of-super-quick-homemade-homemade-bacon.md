![Homemade Bacon](https://img-global.cpcdn.com/recipes/5234672591175680/751x532cq70/homemade-bacon-recipe-main-photo.jpg)

Hello everybody, I hope you are having an incredible day today. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, homemade bacon. It is one of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Homemade Bacon is one of the most favored of current trending foods on earth. It is enjoyed by millions daily. It's simple, it is quick, it tastes yummy. They are nice and they look fantastic. Homemade Bacon is something which I have loved my whole life.

When it comes to bacon you just can&#39;t beat homemade. You have full control over every element: The quality of the pork, the seasonings used, the curing method, the type of wood chips/smoke, the thickness of the slices. There&#39;s no mystery when it comes to making bacon. It is simple and easy and even those minor efforts pay off BIG time!


To begin with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can have homemade bacon using 3 ingredients and 11 steps. Here is how you cook it.

<!--inarticleads1-->

##### The ingredients needed to make Homemade Bacon:

1. Prepare 500 grams Pork belly (block type)
1. Make ready 1 Seasoned salt and pepper
1. Get 1 Wood chips for smoking


That said, also keep in mind that you should cook it at a medium temperature and flip it just once. If you used a lot of sugar in the cure and/or smoked it a long time, the edges will get. If you go to the time and trouble of curing and smoking your own bacon, start by procuring a pork belly worthy of your efforts. This means from organic hogs (or hogs raised humanely without hormones or antibiotics).

If you go to the time and trouble of curing and smoking your own bacon, start by procuring a pork belly worthy of your efforts. This means from organic hogs (or hogs raised humanely without hormones or antibiotics). Or from a heritage breed like Berkshire, Duroc, or Kurobuta. The process for wet cure bacon is very similar. When you pull your first homemade bacon off the smoker—and this is a common sentiment—your heart will swell with pride.
