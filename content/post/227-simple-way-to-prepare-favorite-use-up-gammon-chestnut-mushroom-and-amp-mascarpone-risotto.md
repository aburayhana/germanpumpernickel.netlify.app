recipeinstructions:
- "Heat oil in a large frying or sauté pan and gently fry the onions on a medium-high heat for 4 minutes, stirring only to avoid sticking."
- "Add the mushrooms, garlic and pepper and fry for a further 2 minutes, stirring occasionally."
- "Stir in the rice and cook for a further minute. Then increase the heat to high."
