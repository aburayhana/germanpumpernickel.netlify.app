Based in Barcelona, Spain, Aneto&#39;s broths reflect the very highest commitment to quality. Pancetta (optional) - since minestrone is a vegetable soup it&#39;s a perfect meal for lent. So pancetta, guanciale or lard cut in cubes is completely optional, but it gives an incredible rich, intense flavor to the veggies as if they were cooked in meat stock (which by the way is also an option).
