- "Add some salt in plenty of boiling water (5 liters of water and 3 tablespoons of salt) and boil the pasta for about 4 minutes."
- "When the pasta has a small core remaining when you bite, move it into the sauce pan and coat it with sauce for about 20 seconds. Taste and add some salt if needed."
- "Sprinkle some coarsely grounded pepper if available, garnish it with some parsley and it&#39;s done!!"
- "Cut the leftover edges into triangles and put them in a plastic container.  You can use it just like regular pasta. You can keep them in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days or in the freezer for 2 weeks."
