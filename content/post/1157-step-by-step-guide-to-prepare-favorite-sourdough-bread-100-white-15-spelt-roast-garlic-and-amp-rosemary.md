- " The Levain"
- "75 g Sourdough starter"
- "75 g Bread flour for levain"
- "75 g Water tepid"
- " The Bread"
- "120 g Levain starter"
- "650 g White bread flour"

- "10-12 g Sea salt"
- "525 ml 70 Water tepid"
- " Rice Spelt or Semolina flour for dusting"
recipeinstructions:
- "Day 1 - Morning, take starter out of fridge and feed (50ml plain flour, 50ml water), repeat 5-6 hours later. Another 5-6 hours later make the levain for your bread by mixing together 75g bread flour, 75g water and 75g sourdough starter - leave out over night (10-12hrs), covered but with air hole(s)."
- "Day 2 - Morning, when the Levain is almost ready, mix all of your flour with your water thoroughly &amp; leave (covered) for 30 mins (this strengthens the gluten). When done Pinch &amp; knead in the salt &amp; 120g of your bread levain (the rest is for the bin). Scrunch together to mix fully then leave (covered) for 45 mins."
- "If you want to add flavour do it at this stage 20 mins before stretch and fold. I&#39;ve added roasted garlic and rosemary to this one below."
- "Day 2 - at least 5 sets (1 set = 4 folds) of stretch &amp; folds over minimum 1.5 hours (every 20 mins). After the last, cover and leave for 1.5 hours (the warmer the better)."
- "Next, weigh &amp; cut the dough into 2 pieces ready to shape before bulk fermentation. When shaping, use a dough scraper to pull tight and create tension (watch you tube videos for better understanding)."
- "Once shaped, sprinkle plenty of dusting flour on top so it doesn&#39;t stick, flip over with scraper and put carefully into your banneton or bowl. Make sure well stitched at the top, sprinkle more dusting flour, leave out for 30-45 mins then cover &amp; put into the fridge for 10-12 hours. Or leave out for 4-5 hrs more and bake that night."
- "Day 3 - Take out of fridge whilst Oven is heating to 240&#39;. Get your dutch ovens ready (no knead to heat), put a length of baking paper over bread &amp; flip out carefully into dutch oven so baking paper is on the bottom (prevents burnage). When oven is ready, score your bread for a better rise."
- "Day 3 - Bake in middle or low oven at 225&#39; with lid on for 45 mins then remove lid and turn down to 200 for a further 10 mins. If baking without a dutch oven, add a dish of water to the oven and bake for 45 min straight at 225&#39;."
- "Leave to cool FULLY before cutting. Overnight uncovered I find the best. Wrap and cover in morning to last all week."
