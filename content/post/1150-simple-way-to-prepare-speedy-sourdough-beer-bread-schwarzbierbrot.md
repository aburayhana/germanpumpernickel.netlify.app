recipeingredient:
- " SOURDOUGH PREDOUGH"
- "120 g Rye flour"
- "110 ml water slightly less than 12 cup"
- "1 Tbsp sourdough startermother 12 g"
- " POOLISH PREDOUGH"
- "110 g whole wheat or whole grain spelt flour"
- "110 ml water slightly less than 12 cup"
- "2 pinches active dry yeast"
- " MAIN DOUGH"
- "1 batch each Finished sourdough  poolish from above"
- "270 g bread flour"
- "115 g dark beer or brown ale 12 cup"
- "2 g active dry yeast 12 tsp"
- "10 g kosher salt 2 tsp"
- "10 g honey optional 2 tsp"
- "1 handful each flaxseed and sunflower seeds optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "In separate bowls, mix together the ingredients for the Sourdough Pre-dough and the Poolish Pre-dough. Cover each bowl with plastic and let it at room temp for about 20 hours."
- "After 20 hours the Sourdough Pre-dough should be a little frothy and bigger. The Poolish Pre-dough will be bubbly and bigger."
- "In a large bowl, mix together the two pre-doughs and the rest of the ingredients (except for flaxseed and sunflower seeds) until it comes together into a sticky lumpy dough."
- "Remove the dough onto a well-floured cutting board and knead with the palm of your hands: push the dough down with your hand, fold in over itself and push down again, rotating as you go."
- "Knead for 15-17 minutes. The dough will become more elastic and smooth. If it sticks a lot to the surface or your hands while kneading, dust with a little more flour and scrape up the dough from the surface to incorporate back in."
- "If mixing in flaxseed/sunflower seeds, gradually knead them into the dough after the 15 minutes of kneading."
- "Form into a ball and return to the bowl. Cover with plastic and let rise for 2 hours at room temp (the the dough over itself after 1 hour and return to bowl)."
- "After 2 hours of rising, remove the dough, turn upside down and fold the sides up to form into a ball again (this helps make sure the exposed part of the dough&#39;s skin gets moistened again. Let sit for 20 minutes covered with wrap."
- "Form the round dough into a long, cylindrical loaf. Place it fold-side down on parchment paper and let rise for another 30 minutes."
- "Meanwhile preheat oven to 480°F/250°C. Place a shallow pan at the bottom rack which we&#39;ll use to create steam later. (prepare some boiling water for this too)"
- "When ready to bake, cut a 1 cm deep slit down the center of the bread. (I sprinkled the top of my bread with flaxseed, but I don&#39;t recommend this because it got too dark during baking)."
- "Place the loaf on the center rack on a baking sheet and pour boiling water into the pan below it. Bake for 10 minutes, then carefully remove the tray of steaming water. Turn oven down to 430°F/220°C and bake for 30-35 minutes until the crust is dark and crisp."
- "Remove from oven and let cool on a rack for about 1 hour."
- "Slice and enjoy with butter, cheese, or your favorite accompaniments with bread :)"
