recipeingredient:
- "10 lb corned beef brisket"
- "1/2 cup Hey Grill Hey beef rub"
- "2 tbsp Colemans mustard powder"
- "1 tbsp ground coriander"
- "2 tbsp white sugar"
- "2 tbsp granulated garlic"
- "1 tbsp onion powder"
- " Fresh cracked black pepper"
- " Water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Submerge the corned beef brisket in water to reduce the salt level from the corn beef process. I used a 5 gallon food safe bucket with 4 gallons of water."
- "Change the water every 4-6 hours and do that a minimum of 3 times."
- "Mix all spices together except the black pepper in a jar with a lid that you can control the pour easily. A parmesan cheese lid screws onto a canning jar and works great for this!"
- "Drain the brisket and pat dry."
- "Get the smoker heating you to 275° I used natural lump charcoal and post oak."
- "Coat all sides of the corned beef with the mixed spices. Use a pepper milk and completely coat with a layer of cracked black pepper."
- "Once the smoker is to temp put the brisket on."
- "Smoke for 5-6 hours until the internal temp is 165° then pull to wrap in butcher&#39;s paper."
- "Once internal temp hits 200° to 204° ~it depends on where it finishes and pull it to rest. Mine stalled out at 203° so I pulled it then. It took me a total of 12.5 hours to heat that temp."
- "Let rest about 2 hours in a cooler. Then it&#39;s ready to slice and make into a really awesome sandwich! Bake some bread or buy a nice loaf, whip up a thousand island sauce, melt some white cheddar on the meat then top with a quality kraut."
