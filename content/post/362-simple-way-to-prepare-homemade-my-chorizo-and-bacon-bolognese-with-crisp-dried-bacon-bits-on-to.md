Be sure to watch your bacon, as every microwave is different and your bacon may be finished sooner. Uncured bacon is, generally, left in a more natural, green state than cured bacon and so tastes more like the pork belly itself. It&#39;s also often saltier than cured bacon because the pork has to sit in the brine for longer in order to get to the same level of preservation. Roll up tortilla tightly and place on a plate and then repeat until all the ingredients have been used.
