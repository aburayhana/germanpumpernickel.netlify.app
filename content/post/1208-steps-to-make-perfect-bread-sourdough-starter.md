Remove the amount of starter needed and bring to room temperature. For each ½ cup starter removed, add ½ cup flour and ½ cup warm water to the remaining starter and stir until smooth. What we call sourdough &#34;starter&#34; is a mixture of flour and water that naturally collects yeast and bacteria. It&#39;s part of the bread making process known as a preferment. (To read that word correctly, think of it as pre-ferment, as in, what happens before fermenting.) Any preferment can leaven (raise) and flavor bread. Starter is what makes homemade sourdough bread so unique, because it doesn&#39;t require commercial yeast in order to rise.
