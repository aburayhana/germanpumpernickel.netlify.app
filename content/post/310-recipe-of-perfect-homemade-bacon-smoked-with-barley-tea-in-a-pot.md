recipeinstructions:
- "Rinse the pork belly with water. Remove any blood from the pork when cleaning. Pat dry well."
- "Prick all over the surface with a fork to allow it to absorb the spice well."
- "Combine [A] ingredients. Make sure that the amount of salt and sugar is correct. You don&#39;t have to measure the other spices precisely."
- "Finely shred the bay leaves and sage. Rub the [A] spice mix onto the surface of the pork belly."
- "Put the pork into a resealable bag and massage the meat over the bag. Rest in the fridge for 5 days to one week. Massage the meat gently once a day."
- "After 5 days to one week, soak the pork in water to remove the saltiness. It usually takes 1-2 hours. Slice off a small bit and fry to check the taste."
- "When the taste is right, pat dry. Leave to rest in the fridge for one day to dry."

- "If you don&#39;t want to make the pot dirty, line the bottom of the pot with aluminum foil. I bought a cheap metal rack from a pound shop and cut into a suitable shape to fit in the pot."
- "Place the pork on the rack and start smoking. Keep the heat high until the smoke starts. When the smoke starts, turn down the heat to low and cover with a lid."
- "Turn over the pork halfway through and continue to smoke. It usually takes an hour but it depends on the size of the pork."
- "After smoking, wrap the pork in cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for one day. You can eat it without doing this."
- "After one day, it is ready."
- "You can eat as it is but I like browning the slices in a frying pan without oil."
- "[Note:] Fat drippings stop the smoke. Make a small saucer to place on the smoking mixture to catch the drippings."
