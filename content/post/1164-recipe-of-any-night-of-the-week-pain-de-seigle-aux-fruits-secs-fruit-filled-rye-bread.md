recipeingredient:
- "160 grams Bread strong flour"
- "20 grams Rye flour"
- "20 grams Whole wheat flour"
- "2 grams Dry yeast"
- "2 grams Salt"
- "10 grams Honey or sugar"
- "70 to 80 ml Water"
- "70 to 80 ml Milk"
- "40 grams Dried fruit 1"
- "30 grams Nuts 2"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the dried fruit quickly in boiling water and drain right away. Lightly roast the nuts and chop up."
- "Put the bread flour, rye flour, whole wheat flour and dry yeast in a bowl, and mix lightly."
- "Combine the water, milk and honey, and pour the mixture into the bowl from Step 2. Mix to combine the liquids with the flours, take out onto a work surface, and knead well."
- "When the dough is about 80% kneaded, add the dried fruit and nuts from Step 1 and knead them evenly into the dough. Round off the dough smoothly, put it in a bowl and let it rise (1st rising)."
- "It&#39;s done when it has doubled in volume. I let it rise slowly for 12 hours in the refrigerator. You can also use your oven&#39;s &#34;bread rising&#34; setting to let it rise for 1 to 2 hours."
- "Take the dough out onto a floured work surface and deflate. Divide the dough using a pastry scraper or similar."
- "Round off each piece of dough, with the edges inside. Cover with a tightly wrung out moistened kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and leave to rest for 20 minutes."
- "Form the loaves. Dust the work surface lightly, and roll the dough out into an oval shape."
- "Fold in the top and bottom edges."
- "Fold in half, and pinch the seams securely closed. Roll the dough to neaten up the shape. Form the other pieces in the same way."
- "Line the loaves up on a sheet of kitchen parchment paper with space in between. Leave to rise (2nd rising)."
- "When the loaves increase to 1.5 times their original size they are ready to bake. Preheat the oven and oven tray to 220°C."
- "When the oven has heated up, dust the loaves with flour (not listed in the ingredients) using a tea strainer, and slash the tops."
- "Put the loaves in the oven and bake for 5 minutes at 220°C. Lower the temperature to 200°C and bake for another 10 minutes. Cool the baked loaves on a rack. They&#39;re delicious freshly baked."
- "This is how it looks sliced. It&#39;s packed with fruit and nuts. The revisions that I made to the recipe are detailed in the next step."
- "I reduced the rye flour to half the amount of the whole wheat flour to make the bread easier to eat. Using honey in the dough encourages the yeast to ferment, and also prevents the bread from becoming hard the next day. I made the liquid amount flexible."
