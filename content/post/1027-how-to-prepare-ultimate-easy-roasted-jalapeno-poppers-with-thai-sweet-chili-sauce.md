Chef John&#39;s take on Thai-style sweet chili sauce, or Nam Jim, is sort of a hybrid between the cooked and fresh versions. If you can&#39;t find Thai bird&#39;s eye chilies, use any other combination of fresh, preserved, and/or dried chilies. This sauce is great on grilled chicken and pork. So red jalapeños are older than green jalapeños.
