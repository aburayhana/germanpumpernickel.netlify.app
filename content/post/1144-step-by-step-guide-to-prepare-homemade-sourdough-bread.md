recipeingredient:
- "8 oz Fed Sourdough Starter"
- "12 oz warm water 100110F"
- "2 tsp active dry yeast"
- "1/2 oz sugar"
- "2 1/2 tsp salt"
- "21 1/4 oz allpurpose flour or bread flour"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine all ingredients in mixer. (Referred to as &#34;straight dough method&#34;)"
- "Ensure to scrape down sides of bowl to ensure all ingredients get incorporated."
- "With dough hook, mix on medium low speed (2 or 3 depending on mixer) for about 8-12 minutes until a nice soft dough ball forms. This develops gluten in the bread.  Dough should pull away from sides of bowl (known as cleanup stage)"
- "Dough should be tacky feeling. If it seems to tacky, add small Mounts of flour a little at a time while kneeding. Don&#39;t add to much extra"
- "Note: I add more starter than what recipe calls for; I put about 10-12 ounces of starter based on how I feel, how my starter smells and looks, and just because I can, I started adding more on occasion to experiment to see how different the bread turns out.  To me a little more starter makes bread turn out better. Feel free to give it a go if you feel daring."
- "Place dough into a large lightly greased bowl and tightly cover with plastic wrap."
- "Allow dough to rise until doubled in bulk, about 90 minutes."
- "Gently divide dough in two. It will deflate a little."
- "Gently shape the dough into two oval loaves, or for longed loaves, two 10&#34; to 11&#34; logs or baguettes. Place on a lightly greased or parchment lined baking sheet. Cover and let rise until very puffy, about 1 hour,"
- "Note: I used two cloche to do bread in. This is a stone container that will give that stone oven bake to the bread and gives a great crust to it. I make my two logs and place in stone cloche then cover for the second rise. After rise I remove top, cut my slashes on top And lightly spray water from a spray bottle then recover for the bake. This creates a steam that helps develop bread and crust."
- "Preheat oven to 425°F."
- "Spray loaves with lukewarm water. Cut 2 or 3 slashes diagonal across top. Don&#39;t go to deep"
- "Bake bread 25-30 minutes. If using cloche, uncover for last 5 minutes of bake to allow crust to be one a deep golden brown"
- "Remove from oven and cool on rack before cutting"
- "Enjoy!!!"
