recipeingredient:
- "1 fillet salmon"
- "1 lemon"
- "1 piece ginger"
- " some butter"
- " salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Fill a large pan with water, put the Joule sous vide inside and set the temperature (50ยบ). Make some cuts in the salmon. Squeeze the lemon juice over the fish and rub in with your hands. Then grate the ginger and stuff it into the cuts."
- "Stuff the butter into the cuts too. Sprinkle some salt and grind some pepper over the fish and on the board. Then put the fish on top of the board salt and pepper so that both sides are seasoned."
- "Put the salmon in a sealable bag (I used a zipper one because I didn&#39;t have any special vacuum sous vide bags - it worked fine) and gently lower it into the water, making sure no air is left inside before sealing. Set the time at 45 minutes."
- "I also put some mangetout in with a pinch of salt and some olive oil."
- "The bag kept floating to the top so I had to weigh it down with a pan lid. Have since learned that the best way to cook veg sous vide is to put a metal spoon inside the bag so it acts like a weight. I finished them off in a wok."
- "When the time is up, carefully take the salmon out. Put the juices in the bag in a pan and let them bubble on maximum heat for a couple of minutes and then use that as the sauce."
- "Enjoy!!"
