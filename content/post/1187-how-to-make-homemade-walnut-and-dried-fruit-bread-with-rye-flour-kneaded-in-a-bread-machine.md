recipeingredient:
- "200 grams Bread strong flour"
- "50 grams Rye flour"
- "85 grams Milk"
- "85 grams Water"
- "20 grams Brown sugar or white sugar"
- "20 grams Unsalted butter"
- "5 grams Salt"
- "4 1/2 grams Dry yeast"
- "40 grams Walnuts"
- "80 grams Mixed dried fruit"
recipeinstructions:
- "Toast the walnuts in a dry frying pan, being careful not to let them burn. Alternatively bake them for about 15 minutes in a 150°C oven while keeping an eye on them. Let them cool down completely, then chop up."
- "Put all the ingredients except the ones marked ● in a bread machine. When the &#34;add additions&#34; signal goes off, add the ● ingredients. (I used a finely ground rye flour.)"
- "Make sure the dough has risen properly. If it hasn&#39;t risen enough yet, leave to rise for a few more minutes. If you poke the dough with a flour-covered finger and the hole doesn&#39;t fill back in it&#39;s good."
- "After making sure the dough has risen enough, take it out of the bread machine and round it off. Cover the dough with a tightly wrung out clean, moistened kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and leave to rest for 20 minutes (see third photo)."
- "Dust the bread mold evenly with flour using a tea strainer (not listed in the ingredient list). Deflate and round off the dough, and put it in the mold with the seam side facing up."
- "See how the dough is rising, and preheat the oven to 250°C (heat the baking sheet too). Let the dough rise to almost twice its original volume."
- "Holding the baking sheet with one hand, flip the dough over into the panetton basket. Slash the top of the dough, and mist with water. Lower the oven temperature to 220°C, and bake for 10 minutes. Then lower the temperature to 200°C and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes."
- "If it looks like the top is getting burned, cover the top with a double or triple layer of foil."
- "It&#39;s packed with dried fruit and walnuts. It goes well with wine. It&#39;s delicious spread with cream cheese, butter or honey."
- "Here I divided the dough into 4 and baked them in a coupe shape. They are smaller and cuter. Form the dough into round rolls or any shape you like."
- "When the weather is hot and you use a bread machine, use room temperature water. When the weather is cold use lukewarm water, or the yeast will not mix in properly."
- "For hand-kneading directions, see."

##### Instructions to make Walnut and Dried Fruit Bread with Rye Flour Kneaded In a Bread Machine:

1. Toast the walnuts in a dry frying pan, being careful not to let them burn. Alternatively bake them for about 15 minutes in a 150°C oven while keeping an eye on them. Let them cool down completely, then chop up.

1. Make sure the dough has risen properly. If it hasn&#39;t risen enough yet, leave to rise for a few more minutes. If you poke the dough with a flour-covered finger and the hole doesn&#39;t fill back in it&#39;s good.
1. After making sure the dough has risen enough, take it out of the bread machine and round it off. Cover the dough with a tightly wrung out clean, moistened kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and leave to rest for 20 minutes (see third photo).
1. Dust the bread mold evenly with flour using a tea strainer (not listed in the ingredient list). Deflate and round off the dough, and put it in the mold with the seam side facing up.

Our original contribution to the no-knead bread revolution: substitute live sourdough starter for instant yeast to create the ultimate no knead artisan bread loaf. Substitute rye flour for the whole wheat and toss in some caraway and anise seed for American style rye bread. This bread is a snap to prepare, all you really need is time to let the yeast work. The bread is baked in a Dutch oven or large, heavy pot or crockery. It is recommended that ingredients are weighed when making bread, but if that isn&#39;t possible, try to measure the flour and water as accurately as possible.
