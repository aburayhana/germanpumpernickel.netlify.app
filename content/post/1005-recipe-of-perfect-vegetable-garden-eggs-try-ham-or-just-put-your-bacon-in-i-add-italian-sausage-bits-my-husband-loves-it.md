I don&#39;t like pasta and vegetables. I&#39;m a vegetarian so I don&#39;t eat any meat or fish. Mr linton likes eating meat in every meal - he has sausages and eggs for breakfast and his favourite dish is roast beef. Their son chris is vegetarian - this means that he doesn&#39;t eat meat at all. For lunch he usually has a salad, and in the evening he has fish with pasta or rice.
