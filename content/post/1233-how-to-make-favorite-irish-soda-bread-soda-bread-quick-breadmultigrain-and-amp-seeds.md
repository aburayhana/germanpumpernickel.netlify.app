- "200 gms Allpurpose flour  maida"
- "1/2 tsp Salt"
- "1  14 cups Buttermilk"

recipeinstructions:
- "First of all preheat your oven at 200¬∞C or vessel in which you are going to bake the bread on high flame (use the medium sized burner of the gas stove)as the dough doesn&#39;t have to be proofed like the yeast or sourdough breads. So no waiting time...knead and bake üòÄ. In a bowl, add in all the ingredients."
- "Mix well and add in the buttermilk add about 1/ 4 cup each time, do not add all at a time and knead into a soft and wet kind of dough, hardly it takes five minutes or so,it doesn&#39;t have to be kneaded for a long time as you do for yeast bread to develop the gluten,"
- "Keep it on a board or clean kitchen counter top and shape it into a ball and then flatten it a bit (not too much)with just your hand no need of rolling pin."
- "Keep it on a greased and flour dusted baking tray directly or you can use butterpaper on top of the tray (for added precaution) and grease and dust the butterpaper. Score the breaddough like a cross in the centre and small score(like a hole) on the four quarters of the bread dough. Give a buttermilk wash and sprinkle rolled oats or seeds on it."
- "Place it in the preheated oven, in this case the preheated vessel and bake for 30-35 minutes or until it has browned and a skewer or toothpick inserted in the centre of the bread comes out clean. You can tap the top and bottom of the bread to check if it&#39;s done or not, if it produces hollow sound, it means your bread is done. Take it out of the oven and keep it on cooling rack or any perforated utensil, brush it with butter and let it cool down a bit or to room temperature before you slice."
- "Note : while cooking the breads I generally, even with cakes, I cover it lightly with a clean kitchen cloth, so that it&#39;s moist and soft... because my place is dry kind and has less humidity so it dries off everything left open on the table. Serve with anything you like....I had with hot Potato soup. Bon Appetit!!!"
