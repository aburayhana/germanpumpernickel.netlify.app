recipeingredient:
- "250 g Arborio risotto rice"
- "220 g fresh mushrooms of your choice chopped"
- "Half a handful dried porchini mushrooms"
- "1 small red onion chopped"
- "1 dash malt vinegar"
- "1 good glug dry Vermouth"
- "2 cloves garlic sliced finely"
- "1 litre vegetable stock made with boiling water"
- "1 handful chopped fresh parsley"
- "2 tbsp olive oil"
- "1 heaped tbsp half fat creme fraiche or a glug of whole milk"
- " Grated quality Parmigianino Reggiano cheese to serve"
- " Salt and pepper to season"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add the oil to a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add the chopped onions and a drizzle of malt vinegar and fry until translucent and soft. Next add in the chopped garlic and fry for a further minute then add in the fresh mushrooms. Season well with salt and pepper and stir."
- "Next add in all the dried porchini plus a good dash of dry Vermouth and stir, cook for a minute or two. Add in the rice and cook for around 2 minutes, continually stirring so it doesn&#39;t catch then pour in half the vegetable stock and bring to a simmer."
- "Now keep an eye on it and stir quite regularly, as soon as the stock gets low and has almost evaporated off, add in a couple more ladles of stock, then stir through. You&#39;ll need to repeat this process until the risotto becomes creamier and thickens up. You may need to turn down the heat a smidge if the stock evaporates too quickly."
- "Add in the fresh parsley and stir though to wilt it down. Season with more salt and pepper to taste. Right at the end of cooking, add in the crème fraiche or milk and stir through to make the sauce creamier still. Once the risotto has a creamy thick yet glossy appearance, and the rice has a nice gentle bite to it remove from the heat."
- "Serve up and grate over the cheese, to make extra special add some shavings of truffle. ;) Enjoy!"
