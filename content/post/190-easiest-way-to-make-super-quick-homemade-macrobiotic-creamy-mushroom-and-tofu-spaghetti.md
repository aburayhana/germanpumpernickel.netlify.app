- "1/3 cube Soup stock cube or vegetarian soup stock"
- "1 Salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make the cream: Put the tofu and soy milk in a bowl, mash up the tofu with a spatula, and strain the mixture through a strainer. (I&#39;ve used 1 whole block of tofu in the photo.)"
- "Even if you don&#39;t have a large sieve or strainer, if you immerse a tea strainer in the mixture and turn a rubber spatula round and round inside it, you&#39;ll have a cream-like texture in 5 minutes. Season with 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt and pepper."
- "Make the sauce: Take the stem ends off the shimeji and enoki mushrooms, divide into small clumps, and rinse quickly."

- "Pour plenty of sauce on the pasta, add the  accompanying broccoli and it&#39;s done. The white wine and tofu make this sauce very rich."
