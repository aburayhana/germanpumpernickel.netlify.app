- "Drain and rinse the sauerkraut in a colander"
- "Squeeze excess water out of the sauerkraut and put it in a large pot with a lid"
- "Add the caraway seeds to the sauerkraut and add just enough water to cover. Mix it up, put the lid on the pot and let it simmer on low to medium heat for at least 3 hours to allow the caraway flavor to soak into the sauerkraut. Stir occasionally."

- "After two hours or so, the pork should be tender enough to cut with a spoon, if it isn&#39;t let it simmer a bit longer. But that&#39;s when you know it&#39;s done. Let it cool down."
- "Once it&#39;s cooled to about room temperature, add the sour cream, mix well and heat it up again, stirring occasionally."
- "At this point you can serve it, but it&#39;s better if you let it come back to room temperature and put it in the fridge overnight, heat it up again, and eat it the next day. I guarantee this won&#39;t be enough!"
