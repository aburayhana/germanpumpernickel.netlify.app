recipeingredient:
- "2 bars Ghana milk chocolate"
- "80 grams Butter or margarine"
- "2 Eggs"
- "30 grams Flour"
- "10 grams Cocoa powder"
- "30 grams Sugar for people who like sweet taste"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the flour and cocoa powder, and sift. Preheat the oven for 170℃."
- "Crush the chocolate and put into a bowl. Add the butter, and melt them over a double-boiler or in a microwave."
- "(When you are using the double-boiler, remove the chocolate from it at this point.) Add the eggs, and mix well quickly. The mixture will become a little bit thick."
- "Add the sifted flour and cocoa powder, and mix well. Pour the mixture into the ramekins."
- "Bake for 10-15 minutes in the oven at 170℃. When you bake too long, the inside won&#39;t be creamy, so bake until just the surface is cooked."
- "Once it&#39;s cooled, you can microwave for 20 seconds at 600 W, and the creaminess on the inside will come back."
- "Addendum: When you are making this using paper cups, bake for about 9 minutes. Please check them occasionally."
- "Even when you are using baking ceramic crocks, check them after about 10 minutes of baking."
- "Once the surface is cooked, insert a bamboo skewer around the edge instead of the middle, and check the doneness. If the edge is not liquidy, you can take it out from the oven."
