- "500 grams A block of pork belly block or pork shoulder loin"
- "2 tsp Salt"
- "1 Rub in garlic black pepper or your choice of herbs to taste"
recipeinstructions:
- "Coat the entire block of pork in salt, then rub in garlic to taste. If you have rosemary, sprinkle on the surface. (I used half a block of pork.)"
- "Wrap in paper towels, then in plastic wrap, or put it in a resealable bag. Put it in the refrigerator and wait 1 full day! You can eat it the next day."
- "Replace the paper towel every 1-2 days. It will keep for 10 days in the refrigerator. When it&#39;s preserved for a long time, it will naturally turn into bacon."
- "When serving, boil the salted pork in plenty of water for about 20 minutes to remove the excess salt (over low heat). Slice it up, cook it and enjoy the great taste!"
- "To make a nice marinade: Combine 3 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 tablespoon vinegar, 2 tablespoons ground sesame seeds, 2 teaspoons grated garlic, and 1 teaspoon grated ginger."
- "You can eat boiled pork plain, make Chinese-style buns, or sandwich it in pita bread."
- "Make a beef consommé  soup from the broth after boiling it; It has plenty of flavor. Make ramen or cold memil guksu, top it with boiled pork, and serve."
- "To make oven baked pork: After blanching the pork in boiling water until the surface turns white, bake it in the oven for for 1 hour at 200 ℃."
- "Put vegetables in a heat-resistant dish together with the pork and bake it in the oven. The salt from the pork will transfer to the vegetables, so no need to season. A meat and vegetable dish in one shot."
- "Cook rice with the broth from boiling the pork, and you have an instant pilaf. The rice will absorb the flavor from the soup! Use the boiled salted pork to make a garlic sauté."
