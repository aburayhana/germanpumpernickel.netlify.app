recipeinstructions:
- "I used this small round rye bread boule - about 380-400 g."
- "Cut the bread up into small cubes. It needs to dry out so you can either leave it sit overnight in the open -or- you can put on a baking sheet and bake fro 10 minutes at 170°C until dry."
- "In a frying pan, briefly saute the onions until soft (and bacon if using). No need to brown. Set aside."
- "In a large bowl, add the bread cubes and pour over warm milk. Mix well and let soak for 10-15 minutes."
- "After the bread has soaked up all the milk, add the sauted onions, parsley, nutmeg, and salt &amp; pepper to taste. Mix by mashing up with your hands."

- "You can mix in bits of bacon if using too (i made half &amp; half!)"
- "Form into 10-12 round dumplings by squeezing together the mixture with your hands. These were a little bigger than a golf ball. (if you have time, let them sit for 15-30 minutes to firm up)."
- "To steam: Set up a steamer and steam for 20 minutes, in batches if needed. This method is the &#34;safer&#34; compared to boiling because the dumplings won&#39;t fall apart."
- "To boil: Bring a large pot of water to a gentle boil and gently slide in each knödel. Simmer on low heat for 20 minutes. Don&#39;t let the water boil strongly or else the knödel could fall apart. Drain and serve."
