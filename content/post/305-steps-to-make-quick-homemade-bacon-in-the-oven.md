recipeinstructions:
- "This recipe calls for 1 tablespoon of salt for each 500g of pork belly. So for 750g of pork belly, you need 1 1/2 tablespoons of salt. Sprinkle the salt onto the pork belly and rub it in well, coating all sides. Place into a ziplock bag. Put it into the refrigerator to rest for 2 days."
- "Preheat the oven to 250F/120C.  Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.  Open the tea bags and spread the black tea over parchment paper. Lay the pork belly, fat side down, on top of the black tea. Put into the preheated oven to bake for 90 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow to sit for 20 minutes before removing it from the oven."
- "If you allow the meat to cool, you can remove the black tea that is sticking to the surface by wiping it with a plastic bag. The flavor of the black tea should now permeate the meat, creating a pleasant effect."
