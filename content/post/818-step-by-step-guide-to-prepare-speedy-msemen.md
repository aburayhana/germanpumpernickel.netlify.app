recipeingredient:
- "1 cup flour"
- "1 cup fine semolina"
- "1 Theaspoon sugar"
- "1 Theaspoon salt"
- "1/3 Theaspoon yeast"
- "2/3 cup water"
- " for folding and cooking the msemen"
- "1 cup vegetable oil"
- "1/2 cup fine semolina"
- "1/3 cup on salted butter"
- "1 cup chopped parsley"
- "1/2 cup feta cheese"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix all the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Add 1 1/2 cups of warm water, and mix to form a dough. Add more water if necessary to make a dough that is soft and easy to knead, but not sticky. If the dough is too sticky to handle, add a little flour one tablespoon at a time. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead by hand for 10 minutes, (or knead the dough in a stand mixer with dough hook for 5 minutes), until the dough is very smooth and elastic."
- "Set out some vegetable oil, fine semolina, and soft unsalted butter, cheese mix These will be used when shaping the dough. Prepare a large, smooth surface for working with the dough. A large plastic tray or a clean counter is fine. Spread the work surface with a little vegetable oil so the dough won&#39;t stick. Keeping your hands and the dough well-oiled, divide the msemen dough into smooth balls. Set the balls of dough on an oiled surface. Be sure the dough is well-oiled so that it won&#39;t dry out."
- "Allow the dough to rest a few minutes before working with it in the next step. Take a ball of dough (work in order, starting with the first ball of dough you shaped), dip it in the oil, and use oiled hands to flatten and spread the dough into a very thin circle or irregular square. Make it as thin as you can without breaking the dough. A small hole or two in the dough is okay; they&#39;ll be concealed when you fold the dough."
- "Dot the dough with butter and then sprinkle the dough with a little semolina. This will help keep the folded layers separate when the msemen cooks.​ put 2 spoons parsley and feta cheese mix in the middle of the circle."
- "Fold one side of the dough into the center as shown. Fold the opposite side into the center to make a narrow strip of dough. Fold one end of the strip of dough to the center. Fold the opposite end of dough to the center to make a square. Set aside the folded dough on an oiled surface. Repeat the process until all the balls of dough have been folded into squares."
- "Heat a frying pan, cast iron skillet or griddle over medium to medium high heat. Take a square of dough, and pat it with your fingers or palm of your hand to flatten it until approximately double in size. Place the msemen in the pan and fry, turning over several times, until golden brown and the center of the msemen is cooked (it should be chewy, but not gummy or raw). This should take several minutes. Repeat with all of the dough. Remove to a rack to cool, and enjoy!"
