I will try this at some point based on your trip report. Let peppers cool in the oil, transfer everything to the blender jar and add water while blending to make a creamy sauce. I also add lime juice or vinegar to sharpen the salsa taste. If blending whole jalapenos, a coarse strainer can be used to remove bits of seeds and charred skin. The salsa should have some texture and body.
