You may want to spray the pan or use parchment paper"
- "Cook the dough or crescent rolls until almost all the way done. If you cook it all the way , it&#39;s ok just be careful when you put it back in so you don&#39;t burn it."
- "While the dough is baking,  start your eggs. Make scrambled eggs however you normally do. I just add milk, salt and pepper to mine. I took some of my sausage and added it to my eggs."
- "If you are using a block of cheese,  shred that up."
- "On your cooked dough or whatever your using,  spread your sausage gravy evenly over top. Leave an edge so that it basically becomes like the pizza crust.  Next , top that with eggs. Last, but not least,  spread your cheese all over the top."
- "Place this back into the oven and get the dough all the way cooked ( which should only be about the same time as it will take to melt the cheese ) . After the cheese is melted,  it should be nice and hot and done all the way.  Cut into slices and serve. Enjoy !"
