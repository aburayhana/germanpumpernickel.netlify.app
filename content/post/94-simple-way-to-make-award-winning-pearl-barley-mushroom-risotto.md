recipeingredient:
- "200 g pearl barley"
- "1 onion diced finely"
- "2 large cloves garlic sliced very finely"
- "Handful fresh parsley leaves roughly chopped few as garnish"
- "8 g dried Porchini mushrooms larger broken to smaller pieces"
- "1.25 litres boiling water with 12 cube vegetable stock"
- "1 glug of white wine optional"
- " Sea salt and cracked black pepper to season"
- "1 tbsp vegetable oil"
- "1/2 tbsp salted butter"
- " Parmesan cheese to grate over"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add oil to a large saucepan and warm over a medium heat. Add the onions and a good grind of black pepper and softly cook them until translucent, stirring occasionally, this will take around 6-8 minutes. Add in a good pinch of salt and the garlic and fry for 10-15 seconds until fragrant."
- "Add the pearl barley and the white wine and combine everything together well, fry for around a minute whilst stirring to evaporate off the alcohol a little. Add in the dried mushrooms and pour in half a pint of stock (250ml) and stir. Once the stock has almost reduced, pour in another 250ml. Continue to simmer over a medium heat, stirring occasionally."
- "Continue this process of reducing down the stock and then adding another 250ml stock until the pearl barley is tender and cooked but still with a gentle bite to it. Right towards the end you may need to turn down the heat a smidge so the liquid reduces slower. Remove from the heat and add in most of the chopped parsley reserving a little as garnish. Add in the butter and gently stir through, to make the risotto beautifully creamy."
- "Serve up and garnish with more fresh parsley, salt and pepper to taste and a grating of quality Parmigianino Reggiano cheese. Enjoy! :)"
