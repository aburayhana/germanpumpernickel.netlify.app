- "55 grams Chocolate"
- "40 grams Unsalted butter"
- "10 grams Cake flour"
- "10 grams Pure cocoa powder"
- "1 large egg"
- "18 grams Sugar"
- " To decorate"
- "1 Any kind of powdered sugar that wont melt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Chop the chocolate, and place in a bowl with the butter. Melt in a double broiler."
- "Mix together the cake flour and pure cocoa powder, then sift."
- "Aside from the the Step 1 mixture, warm the eggs in a double broiler while whisking. Add the sugar and, using your finger to test, remove from the broiler once the mixture is warm to the touch."
- "Add the Step 2 mixture to the Step 1 chocolate and butter (should be about 30°C) and mix with a whisk."
- "Add the whisked egg from Step 3 to the Step 4 mixture and gently mix with a whisk."
- "Pour into muffin cups, and bake for 10-12 minutes in an oven preheated to 180°C. Once baked, leave to cool on a wire rack."
- "Fresh from the oven, the chocolate is molten and absolutely delicious. If they&#39;ve gone cold, please heat them in the microwave before eating so that the chocolate melts. For these four pictured cakes, I used twice the listed ingredient quantities."
- "If heating the cold cakes in the microwave, be sure to remove any aluminium muffin wrappers etc. first, as they are not safe to microwave."
- "To bake in ramekins: lightly grease the ramekins with vegetable oil, dust with cake flour using a tea strainer, then pour in the batter."
- "You can make 3 cakes if using 7.5 cm diameter ramekin molds, since they have thicker walls than the muffin cups. In this case, reduce baking time to 9 minutes. They will continue to cook once removed from the oven, so please eat straight away."
- "Baking time will vary from oven to oven, so test by sticking a skewer into the centres two minutes early. They&#39;re done if thick batter sticks to the skewer."
