recipeingredient:
- "4 lbs pork belly cuts"
- "150 ml SanJ Organic tamari sauce"
- "50 ml Lee kun kee dark premium soy sauce"
- "50 ml Shaoxin rice wine"
- "50 ml Rum"
- "120 g brown sugar"
- "60 g sea salt"
- "20 g Sichuan peppercorn"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large cast iron wok, sauté sea salt until light brown on low heat. Add Sichuan peppercorn and keep stir until aromatic for about 1 min."
- "In a medium sauce pan, dissolve toasted salt and Sichuan peppercorn and brown sugar in heated Soy sauce mixer. Once dissolved, turn off the stove and wait until the mixture cools down. Add wine and liquor."
- "Marinate pork belly slice in the brine juice for 48 hours at room temperature."
- "Hang the belly up to dry cure for at least 30 days and it could be up to 2 months depends on the thickness of your cuts. During cold dry days, it&#39;s best to hang them outside in a place where there&#39;s no direct sun. During raining warming winter days, it&#39;s all right to hang in heated room as long as the air is not too moist. Refrigerator curing may work but I think it will take longer time and it will use up your storage space."
- "The left piece is dry cured for 48 hours and the right piece was just hang right after marination."
- "All seasonings I used."
