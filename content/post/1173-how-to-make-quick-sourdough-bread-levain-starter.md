It would be taking 2 days. Rest of the water can be stored in the fridge until making another levain/starter. More fermenting as a result. Quantity of the ingredients is up to you. Making bigger one, like 100g each, would be fine. Just think how often you make a bread in a week."
- "Decide not gonna bake a bread today, just keep the jar in the fridge, tightly lid on. You don&#39;t need to feed everyday, maybe once a week. But ideal to check the jar sometime. If the levain is too liquidly, add some flour and stir well, if too dry, add some water."
