recipeinstructions:

This way the skins of the potatoes will peel straight off with your fingers, nothing else needed."
- "Once potatoes are peeled, dice LARGELY!! Peel eggs and dice LARGELY, as well. When you mix everything it will come together great, so go BIGGER on cutting up the POTATOES N EGGS!! That&#39;s kinda the great thing about this recipe your cuts don&#39;t have to be perfect!! Go ahead and add garlic and seasoning (salt, pepper, creole, ect.) and stir it up!!"
- "Last step!! Mix it all together!!! Add the mustard, mayo, relish!! The longer you can let it sit, and marinate, it makes it better. I usually make mine the night before and that&#39;s the way my family likes it!!"
