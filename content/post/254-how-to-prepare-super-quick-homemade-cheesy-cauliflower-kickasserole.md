recipeingredient:
- "2 heads cauliflower"
- "3-4 tb minced garlic"
- "1/2 cup green onions"
- "1 cup minced shiitake mushrooms"
- "9 strips bacon or turkey bacon"
- "1-2 cups heavy whipping cream"
- "1 cup sour cream"
- "1 cup mayo"
- "1 block cream cheese softened"
- "4-5 cups cheese Sharp cheeses make this dish stand out"
- "1-1/2 cups parmesan cheese"
- " Paprika"
- " Cracked black pepper"
- " Cayenne pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "First, clean and cut your cauliflower. Keep the pieces sort of big, as this adds consistency to the dish. Add these to your steamer but do not start steaming yet."
- "Next, shred all of your cheeses onto a plate. The better quality cheeses you use, the better this dish is. I used mostly white cheeses and a couple cups of sharp cheddar."
- "Warm cream cheese slightly in the microwave to soften (30 seconds or so) and add to a large mixing bowl."
- "Next add the garlic, sour cream, mayo, green onions, and almost all of the shredded cheese (reserve some cheese to top with)"
- "Add parmesan cheese"
- "Mix this well, adding small amounts of the heavy whipping cream. You want a creamy mixture."
- "Now start to steam your cauliflower. Just a little water in a pot on boil. Once boiling, reduce to simmer and cover ab 5 minutes or until cauliflower is slightly soft, tender but still a little firm. You want it to hold up for texture in the oven, so a little firm is good."
- "While the cauliflower is steaming, start cooking your bacon. You will need 9 strips. I made mine on the crunchy side since it will get softer during the bake time."
- "Shroomies üçÑ"
- "Chop the mushrooms while the bacon is cooking. Chop them small so that it&#39;s basically undectable once the casserole is finished. Mushrooms serve to add more texture &amp; consistency while adding a touch of richness in flavor."
- "Pre heat your oven to 350¬∞F."
- "The cauliflower should finish before the bacon. When it&#39;s done, drain 3/4 of the water out, then dump the cheese mixture in the pot with the cauliflower, add cracked black pepper &amp; cayenne (If u want a kick), and mix around."
- "Chop 8 strips of bacon into small crumbs and add with mushrooms into cheese &amp; cauliflower mix."
- "Mix everything well, using the spoon and even a knife to break down the larger cauliflower pieces. You want a chunky, creamy mixture. Now is the time to add more heavy cream if you think the mixture is sticky instead of creamy."
- "When everything is mixed well, add to casserole dish and pack down."
- "Take your last strip of bacon and cut coarsely - add on top along with the reserved shredded cheese &amp; paprika."
- "Bake uncovered in the oven on 350¬∞F for about 45 minutes, or until bubbly and the cheese is slightly browned."
- "I used fresh green beans for a side and made this a complete meal. SO GOOD! üíñ"
