recipeinstructions:
- "Using a large bowl, dissolve the sourdough starter in the warm water (it shouldn&#39;t be very hot)."
- "Add most of the flour, the salt and whatever spice you have chosen (if you like). Knead well and add as much flour as is necessary to make a dough that doesn&#39;t stick to your hands. Take care to not add too much flour because the bread will be very firm."

- "Shape your dough into loaves and place in respective trays which you have brushed lightly with oil. Score the top with a knife and brush with a little water (at this point you can sprinkle with sesame seeds and press them a bit with your hand). Set them aside to rise once more."
- "Bake in a preheated oven at 200°C, for about 40&#39; (depending on the oven and the size of the bread)."
