##### The ingredients needed to make Paneer green peas pulav:

1. Prepare 1 cup Basmati rice

1. Make ready 1/2 cup Green peas
1. Prepare 1 spoon Jeera / cumin

Paneer is not really mandatory for this dish. You can skip it and make this dish as it is. I like to lightly shallow fry the paneer first since it helps to add color to the otherwise plain looking rice dish. Adding paneer with the rice to cook makes the paneer rubbery so I use this method of toasting and adding it finally.
