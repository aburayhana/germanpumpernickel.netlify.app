Hey everyone, it is Brad, welcome to our recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a distinctive dish, sourdough rye bread. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I'm gonna make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Sourdough Rye Bread is one of the most well liked of recent trending foods in the world. It's enjoyed by millions every day. It's easy, it's fast, it tastes yummy. They are fine and they look fantastic. Sourdough Rye Bread is something which I have loved my whole life.

Homemade rye sourdough bread is a glorious choice for sandwiches, or eating on its own. Made with a blend of whole wheat, bread flour, and rye flour, this naturally fermented loaf holds its shape and has a moist, chewy crumb. The rustic crust is deeply colored and boasts beautiful blisters! Mix until fully combined, cover, and let stand at room temperature overnight.


To get started with this recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can cook sourdough rye bread using 5 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Sourdough Rye Bread:

1. Make ready 2 cups organic dark rye flour
1. Prepare 1 cup sourdough starter
1. Get 1 cup cooled water after boiling
1. Take 1/2 tsp salt
1. Take 1 Tsp grape molasses


Do not place it in any plastic as this will soften the crust. Instead, pop the loaf into a paper bag or a bread bin. It&#39;s a bit lighter than a full-on rye, but packed with wonderful flavor. I love King Arthur Flours sourdough rye recipe, but it is for a bread machine, which I don&#39;t like.

It&#39;s a bit lighter than a full-on rye, but packed with wonderful flavor. I love King Arthur Flours sourdough rye recipe, but it is for a bread machine, which I don&#39;t like. Mainly because of the shape of the finished loaf, so I mix and knead it in the bread machine, and after the first rise, I shape and bake in the oven. It&#39;s my first ever sourdough bread and was a bit nervous about starting off with rye flour. This recipe is perfect for beginners.
