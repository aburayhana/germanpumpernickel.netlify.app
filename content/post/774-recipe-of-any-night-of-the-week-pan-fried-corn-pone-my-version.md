- "As needed oil to fry in 14 cup total"

- "3 large eggs"
- "1/2 teaspoon water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat a cast iron skillet and spray with nonstick spray."
- "Mix the batter and add the corn."
- "Mix very well no lumps. If it&#39;s too runny add a little cornbread mix. You want this like waffle or pancake batter."
- "Add to the skillet about a dessert spoon size"
- "Let cook till craters form"
- "Flip them then and cook 2-3 minutes on second side."
- "Move to a paper towel"
- "OK the fry in oil method add oil to the skillet and fry in oil. Yes this does actually change the texture and flavor of the corn pone."

- "Add the lid and add the water under the lid and close for 1-1/2 minutes turn down the heat. This will toughen up and form a slight skin to make this a bit easier to flip without splatter or falling apart."

- "Serve I hope you enjoy!!!"
