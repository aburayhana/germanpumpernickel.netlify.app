recipeinstructions:
- "If you summarise how to make bacon, it is just salting and smoking. That&#39;s it!  Prepare the curing liquid to preserve the pork."
- "Put all the ingredients, except the whisky, in a pot and bring to a boil. Turn off the heat and add the whisky. Leave to cool and it is ready."
- "Rinse the pork belly block and pat dry with kitchen paper. Put into a resealable bag and add 200-300 ml of the liquid."
- "Leave to sit in the fridge for about 1 week. Massage the meat now and then."
- "After 1 week, remove the pork from the bag and rinse with water. Place the pork block in a bowl of water and leave to sit with a thin stream of tap water running for 2-3 hours."
- "Slice off a small bit and fry. Check the taste. If it is not quite salty enough, it is ready. If it is salty enough at this point, the cured bacon will be too salty later."
- "Pat dry and leave to rest in the fridge uncovered for 1 day to dry the surface."
- "Put the pork belly and smoking wood in a smoker. Smoke at 70-80 ˚C for 4 hours."
- "Make a small saucer with aluminum foil and place onto the smoking wood to catch the drippings. Dripping fat can stop the smoke."
- "After smoking, hang the bacon in the shade for a whole day. Now it&#39;s ready!"
- "If you eat it straight away after smoking, the bacon tastes too smoky and somewhat sour. It is not that good, so be patient!"
- "You will get an ultimate bacon, totally different from the shop-bought ones! This bacon is great with drinks."
- "The leftover liquid keeps in the fridge for several months!"
