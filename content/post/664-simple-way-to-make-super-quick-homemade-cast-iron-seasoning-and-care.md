recipeingredient:
- "1 Cast Iron Pot or Pan"
- "1 Cloth"
- "1 Bottle of vegetable oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Seasoning - Using a cloth lightly coat vegetable oil all over entire pan or pot.  Place pot or Pan in oven upside down and set it to 200째F.  Once oven and pan are heated, take out pan or pot (be extremely careful as it will be hot).  Using same cloth and very slight amount of oil, re-coat rubbing the oil into the fine cracks of the Cast Iron that open as it is heated.  Make sure there is no excess oil to dripping from pan.  Set oven to 400째F and re-insert the pan upside down and bake for 1 hour.  Let pan cool and your done."
- "Rusted Cast Iron - soak in white vinegar for a couple of hours.  After soak, use wire brush to scrape off all rust and discoloration in the iron.  You can use 1 part vinegar to 1 part water so you are not burning through a bunch of vinegar in a large project.  You may need to repeat a few times to get all of it."
- "Cleaning - While cast iron is still warm (not hot), use hot water only and soft bristle brush to get off surface gunk.  NEVER USE SOAP! Soap breaks down your seasoning by disolving the oil fat.  If you use soap, strip it all the way down with wire brush and re-season.  ALWAYS dry off cast iron and heat on low stove top for 2 minutes to dry off.  Once dry you can use coarse salt and a brush to work any hard caked on gunk.  But remember, cast iron leftovers just add seasoning and flavor to your next cook."
- "Preparation for cooking - a good season on a pan will last a while, but you can extend it by adding either a grease smere of butter on the pan to keep it from sticking, or light oil."
- "Good practice - it&#39;s always a good practice idea to oil a little after washing.  Keeps a nice season on it, but make sure you wipe down extra oil so the pan is not overly greasy."
- "Never - Never put in a dishwasher"
- "Prior cook char spots.  Every pan will get them unless you strip the pan down and re-season it before every use which is impracticle.  Just remember to grease those char spots before cooking and as long as it&#39;s not a large glob of left overs, won&#39;t become a problem."
