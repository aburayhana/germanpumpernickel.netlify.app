recipeinstructions:
- "Taking a large frying pan or wok, place it on a high heat and add the oil or spray with oil.  Throw in the onion, garlic and mushrooms, turn down the heat and leave to soften for about 10 - 15 mins.  Once softened add the risotto rice, quickly stir for about a minute so the heat cracks open the grains."
- "Once the rice grains have been heated add the white wine to the mushrooms.  On a medium heat keep stirring well until the liquid has been absorbed by the grains.  Next add a ladle of stock.  You need to keep adding the stock stirring well each time so it doesn&#39;t stick.  It takes about 20 - 25 minutes to add all the stock depending on your hob."
- "As you stir try to press down on the grains, this helps them absorb more fluid and expel the sticky starch. Add the paprika, salt and pepper and stir well, once all the stock has been absorbed you need to taste the grains.  If they are still a little grainy, you need to add some more hot water to the rice.  Whilst it is finally cooking, grate the cheese.  There isn&#39;t an exact time for cooking risotto, it depends on many factors"
- "The best way is to keep tasting, when it is slightly firm to bite but no grains inside its ready! When it is ready add the cheese stir well, then throw in  the basil and spinach. Stir again!"
- "Turn off the heat and place a lid onto the pan.  Leave it to steam and rest for 2 minutes."
- "That&#39;s is its ready to plate up. Enjoy, Emily x"
